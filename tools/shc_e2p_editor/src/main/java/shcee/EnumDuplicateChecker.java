 * This concept was chosen to aviod the necessity to support dependencies/references
 * between enums in XML and source code files.
 * Enum definitions in the generated source code files are surrounded by #ifdef guards
 * so the first definition encountered during compilation is taken. This is ok
 * as long as every further definitions are identical anyways.
