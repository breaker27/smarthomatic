smarthomatic
============

smarthomatic (SHC) is an **open source home automation system**
providing a framework for building up a bigger network of sensors and
actuators that all work together. It consists of several completely
developed hardware devices you can build up yourself and the software
running on those devices.

This project **concentrates on the hardware devices** and their software
(firmware), not on end user interfaces for control tasks like web
interfaces or smartphone apps. Nonetheless this system is designed to be
easily integrated in such systems.
